The code for the first question is located in the folder part1.

In the code part 2, questions 1-8 required by the second question are answered in detail. We used three classifiers: knn, svm, and som, and performed five feature extraction methods (RawPixels, Histogram, Edges, Gabor, HoughTransform) for each classifier, in which knn also changed the k value for horizontal comparison. Since the code is related to part of the content of questions 1-6, only the first part of question 7: KNN-RawPixels is shown. The rest of the code is written in the form of comments and marked according to the classifier-feature extraction method. . If the reproducer needs to change to a different classifier and feature extraction method, please comment the "Question 7" part and uncomment the response part.

p_dataset_26. zip is the compressed file of the training set for the second question

Prj_Computer+-+ME5405.pdf is the requirement of the project

The png folder saves the pictures of the first question and the second question

ME5405 G31 v4.docx is the final presentation report
